# Abandoned Hospital Simulator 2017 - Text adventure game
Text adventure game - Abandoned Hospital Simulator 2017 - A text adventure game utilizing Python and HeidiSQL


This is a school project me and my group made in 3 weeks during our first half of the first semester in Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. 
The game includes 3 files: The main game, a HeidiSQL database and a create user commands text file.

In order to run the game, you have to first initialize the database by running the database file in HeidiSQL. 
Then you need to run the Createuser.txt file in HeidiSQL.
After that you can run the main game file in Python and experience the game of the century.
