Text adventure game - Abandoned Hospital Simulator 2017 - A text adventure game utilizing Python and HeidiSQL


This is a text adventure game me and my group made in 3 weeks during our first semester in Metropolia. 
The game includes 3 files: The main game, a HeidiSQL database and a create user commands text file.

In order to make the game work, you have to first initialize the database by running the database file in HeidiSQL. 
Then you need to run the Createuser.txt file in HeidiSQL.
After that you can run the main game file in Python and experience the game of the century.
